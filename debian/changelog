cadaver (0.23.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control, debian/rules:
    - Explicitly build-depend and link against libgcrypt. The function is used
      by cadaver directly, causing a build failure with current build tools.
      Thanks to David Su√°rez for reporting this (Closes: #720800).
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped standards-version to 3.9.4.
  * debian/rules:
    - Added build-arch and build-indep targets.
